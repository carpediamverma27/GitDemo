STRING

1)String is sequence or group of characters.
2)String is a class present in java.lang package, but also used as datatype.
3)Strings are immutable, cannot be modify the same string object.

we acn define the string in two ways-

1)Declaration & Initialization of String.
2)create a copy of existing String and gives the output as in its specified functionality.   

Different ways to print in java-

i) System.out.print(""); --> next executing line will print in same line.
ii) System.out.println("");-->next executing line will print in new line. 
iii) System.out.printf("");-->the values of variables can print in this way-->("X values is %d and Y value is %f");
iv)  System.out.format("");-->Same as printf(), both works same. the values of variables can print in this way-->("X values is %d and Y value is %f");

%d-->used for integer value.
%f-->used for float value.
%c-->used for char value.
%s-->used for String value.

Note- We can defined the values of decimals and floats in PRECISION AND SCALE FORMATE.
	Ex- b=5.6454f
	S.o.p("the value of b is: %8.2f",b);
	output- the avlue of b is _ _ _ _ 5.65
